    <p>I was a ghost, I was alone, hah
Eoduwojin apgilsoge (Ah)
Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe
I was the queen that I'm meant to be
I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
But I couldn't find my own place
Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
But now that's how I'm getting paid, kkeuteopsi on stage

I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm born to be
We're dreaming hard, we came so far, now I believe

We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowin'
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up with our voices
Yeongwonhi kkaejil su eomneun
Gonna be, gonna be golden

Oh, I'm done hidin' now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

Waited so long to break these walls down
To wake up and feel like me
Put these patterns all in the past now
And finally live like the girl they all see

No more hiding, I'll be shining like I'm born to be
'Cause we are hunters, voices strong, and I know I believe

We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up, with our voices
Yeongwonhi kkaejil su eomneun
Gonna be, gonna be golden

Oh, I'm done hidin', now I'm shining like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden
We're gonna be, gonna be
Born to be, born to be glowin'
Balge binnaneun uri
You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

[Korean:]

I was a ghost, I was alone, hah
어두워진 앞길속에 (Ah)
Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe
I was the queen that I'm meant to be
I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
But I couldn't find my own place
Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
But now that's how I'm getting paid, 끝없이 on stage

I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm born to be
We're dreaming hard, we came so far, now I believe

We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowin'
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up with our voices
영원히 깨질 수 없는
Gonna be, gonna be golden

Oh, I'm done hidin' now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

Waited so long to break these walls down
To wake up and feel like me
Put these patterns all in the past now
And finally live like the girl they all see

No more hiding, I'll be shining like I'm born to be
'Cause we are hunters, voices strong, and I know I believe

We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up, with our voices
영원히 깨질 수 없는
Gonna be, gonna be golden

Oh, I'm done hidin', now I'm shining like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden
We're gonna be, gonna be
Born to be, born to be glowin'
밝게 빛나는 우리
You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

[English translation:]

I was a ghost, I was alone, hah
In the darkness, hah, a pressured path (Ah)
Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe
I was the queen that I'm meant to be
I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
But I couldn't find my own place
Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
But now that's how I'm getting paid, endlessly on stage

I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm born to be
We're dreaming hard, we came so far, now I believe

We're going up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up with our voices
Unbreakable forever
Gonna be, gonna be golden

Oh, I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

Waited so long to break these walls down
To wake up and feel like me
Put these patterns all in the past now
And finally live like the girl they all see

No more hiding, I'll be shining like I'm born to be
'Cause we are hunters, voices strong, and I know I believe

We're going up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up, with our voices
Unbreakable forever
Gonna be, gonna be golden

Oh, I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden
We're gonna be, gonna be
Born to be, born to be glowing
Shining brightly, we are
You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be</p>
